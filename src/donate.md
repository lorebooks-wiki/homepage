# Support the project

The Community Lorebooks project is operating as a non-profit service and open-source project
under [Recap Time Squad](https://recaptime.dev) and currently covered out of pocket by
@ajhalili2006 for the domain renewal of `lorebooks.wiki` and `stellapent.wiki` domains as well
as the infrastructure that makes this (and other projects) run smoothly.

The easiest way to donate online is through HCB, but we want to let you choose based on
your preference.

=== "HCB"

    [HCB](https://hackclub.com/hcb) is Hack Club's in-house fiscal sponsorship platform +
    program for its partnered organizations, mostly teenager-led. Since we're fiscally
    sponsored through their program, we mainly use it to manage our finances as a team,
    alongside issuing donation invoices and handling reimbursements.

    You can donate to our organization through the embedded donation form below. ([Click here if the frame is too small](https://hcb.hackclub.com/donations/start/lorebooks-wiki)) Donations in the US are tax-deductible to the extent by the IRS guidelines, as long as it is not in exchange for services/gifts.

=== "Open Collective"

    > Open Collective is a platform where communities can collect and disburse money transparently, to sustain and grow their projects. ([from their docs site])

    While we use HCB as our main platform for our fundraising efforts with finanical
    transparency by enabling Transparency Mode, we still using Open Collective to make
    them organized as well as to track expenses and income outside the HCB platform.

    set up one. It's linked to our restricted fund bank account details on HCB through
