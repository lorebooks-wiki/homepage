The Community Lorebooks project is operating as a non-profit service and open-source project
under [Recap Time Squad](https://recaptime.dev) and currently covered out of pocket by
@ajhalili2006 for the domain renewal of `lorebooks.wiki` and `stellapent.wiki` domains as well
as the infrastructure that makes this (and other projects) run smoothly.

your preference.

=== "HCB"

    [HCB](https://hackclub.com/hcb) is Hack Club's in-house fiscal sponsorship platform +
    program for its partnered organizations, mostly teenager-led. Since we're fiscally
    sponsored through their program, we mainly use it to manage our finances as a team,
    alongside issuing donation invoices and handling reimbursements.

    You can donate to our organization through the embedded donation form below. ([Click here if the frame is too small](https://hcb.hackclub.com/donations/start/lorebooks-wiki)) Donations in the US are tax-deductible to the extent by the IRS guidelines, as long as it is not in exchange for services/gifts.

    transparency by enabling Transparency Mode, we still using Open Collective to make
    them organized as well as to track expenses and income outside the HCB platform.
